    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Campaign</h3>
    <p>
      The player assumes the role of various characters during the single-player
      campaign, changing perspectives throughout the progression of the story,
      which, like its predecessors, is divided into three sets of missions
      called "Acts". Each mission in an act features a series of objectives that
      are displayed on the heads up display, which marks the direction and
      distance between such objectives and the player. Damage to the player is
      shown by the visualization of blood-spatter or red-outs on the screen. The
      player's health regenerates over time as long as the player character
      avoids taking damage for a limited time. Mission objectives vary in their
      requirements, ranging from having the player arrive at a particular
      checkpoint, to eliminating enemies in a specified location, to standing
      their ground against enemy squadrons, directing remote-operated weapons,
      and planting explosive charges on enemy installations. The player is also
      accompanied by fellow soldiers who cannot be issued orders. Like its
      predecessor, the game includes an interactive scene of a terror attack
      against civilians, which the player is given the option of skipping due to
      the portrayal of graphic and potentially upsetting content, including harm
      to children.

    <h3>Cooperative</h3>
    <p>
      Modern Warfare 3 features a new mode, called Survival. This mode allows
      between one and two players to fight massive waves of enemies, with each
      wave becoming increasingly difficult. It differs from the Nazi Zombies
      mode in Call of Duty: World at War, principally in that enemies no longer
      spawn at fixed locations like the zombies do, but instead appear at
      tactical positions based on the current location of the player. The mode
      is available on all multiplayer maps in the game. Players earn in-game
      cash for items such as weapons, upgrades, ammo, air/ground support, and
      equipment if they kill or assist in killing enemies, while more items can
      be unlocked by earning XP which is also increased by killing
      enemies.[7][8] Special Ops also returns from Modern Warfare 2. These
      challenge missions feature up to 48 stars, unlike its previous
      installment, which featured 69. Some weapons in Spec Ops are exclusive to
      that game mode, and are not available for play in multiplayer mode.[9]

    <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>
      The entire Killstreak reward system has been altered to make it more
      difficult for players to get early unlocks. Killstreaks are now known as
      Pointstreaks, and kills are no longer the only way to increase the
      player's point streak. Completing objectives such as planting a bomb or
      capturing a flag in Capture The Flag awards points towards the player's
      Pointstreak. Pointstreak rewards are organized into three different
      "strike packages" called Assault, Support, and Specialist. The Assault
      strike package works the same as the Killstreak reward system in Modern
      Warfare 2 and Black Ops: the player must earn more and more points without
      dying. Once the player is killed, their points are reset to zero.
      Likewise, the Specialist strike package rewards players with perks after
      every second consecutive kill. Upon death, however, the player loses all
      the perks and the points are reset to zero. In contrast, the Support
      strike package is awarded based on the total points that the player has
      earned over the entire match, regardless of how often the player dies. It
      is important to note that if a player switches to a custom class with a
      different reward system (either assault or specialist) during gameplay,
      all points are automatically reset to 0.[10] Players are allowed to choose
      which Pointstreak rewards they want to use when they gain it during the
      match, rather than choosing them between rounds. Along with revamping the
      entire Killstreak reward system, Modern Warfare 3 also has a completely
      modified Ranking and Unlocks system, which does not use a currency system
      for unlocks.[11] The player's primary weapon levels up alongside the
      player, and unlocks a number of "Proficiency" perks such as Attachments,
      (allows two attachments and is a successor to the "Bling" and "Warlord"
      perks), Kick (reduced recoil while aiming down the player's sight) and
      Focus (reduced flinching while under fire). Only one Proficiency can be
      put on a primary weapon.[12] Another new addition is the ability to equip
      "Hybrid Scopes" on a weapon, such as a holographic sight with a red dot
      magnifier, allowing players to switch between magnified and
      non-magnified.[12] Modern Warfare 3 introduces a new "Prestige Shop" which
      will unlock only after the player has selected the option to prestige for
      the first time. The "Prestige Shop" allows Prestige players to use tokens
      they gain from using the Prestige option to buy exclusive features such as
      double XP and an extra custom weapon class. The player is able to Prestige
      20 times.[13] Several controversial perks in Modern Warfare 2, accused of
      being too overpowered, have been removed in Modern Warfare 3. Diving from
      standing to prone, known as "dolphin diving", has been removed due to
      balancing issues.[14] Modern Warfare 3 utilized Treyarch's hot fix system
      to fix bugs and glitches.[15] Modern Warfare 3 features a local and online
      split-screen option. (Not available for the Wii version.)[16] New game
      modes were added: Kill Confirmed: players must collect floating dog tags
      from the corpse of a downed enemy before the kill can be registered.
      However, the opposing team can pick up the dog tag as well to deny the
      other team a kill, which denies the other team a point. Team Defender:
      both teams attempt to capture a flag dropped by the first person who is
      killed when the match starts, the team of the person who holds the flag
      will get double points for their kills; while the team without the flag
      only gets the default number per kill. Private matches also now include
      pre-made game modes including: "Infected" (where the infected kill enemies
      to recruit them to their team), "Drop Zone" (where the player must hold a
      drop zone for points and care packages), "Team Juggernaut" (each team
      plays alongside an AI Juggernaut character), "Gun Game" (be the first to
      get one kill with every gun in the game), "One in the Chamber" (in which
      players are only allowed one pistol with one bullet and three lives where
      they can only get more bullets by killing other players), and "Juggernaut"
      (free for all against a juggernaut, kill the juggernaut to become it).
      Along with this, players are allowed to create their own game modes with
      customized settings such as number of players and time limit.[10]
